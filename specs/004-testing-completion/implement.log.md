# Implement Log — 004-testing-completion (`/speckit-implement-parallel`)

> Append-only wave ledger. One line per wave; the pre-flight is recorded above the wave loop
> because per D69 it is **not a wave** (machinery that gates the waves is never itself a wave).
> Orchestrator: main thread (Opus, xhigh). Dispatches: Sonnet assembled agents per the approved
> roster (`agents/assignment.md`, workforce gate `5a7f705`, bound in `gates.yml`).

## Pre-flight (D69/R1-S01) — the bundled git-ext change, provisioned BEFORE Wave 1

The pre-flight is a serial unit (T003→T004→T005→T006→T007→T008): one git-ext source change
(verify-gate.sh checkbox-delta + commit.sh `testing` enum + after_testing/after_complete hooks)
→ one reinstall → one survival regression. `implement-parallel` **refuses to enter Wave 1 until
T008 reports both survival regressions green** (SC-010 provisioning).

- `2026-07-12T19:47Z` | before_implement verify-gate workforce | tasks.md @ 9601bcd (pristine, just-bound) + agents/assignment.md @ 5a7f705 | **exit 0 (PASS)** — R1-S11 non-circularity first-firing: the gate passes on a pristine tasks.md PRE-FIX (exact-match fast path, no audit line). Wave 1's own `[X]`-mark is the sole hazard; this window is safe.
- `2026-07-12T19:47Z` | **pre-flight gate CLOSED → Wave 1 REFUSED** | reason: T008 not done (the bundled git-ext change is not yet built/reinstalled/survival-verified). This refusal is the first half of the SC-010 evidence pair (refuse-then-release); the second half is the wave-2+ freshness checks passing unassisted after the fix goes live.
- `2026-07-12T20:03Z` | pre-flight T003 (agt_security) | verify-gate.sh checkbox-delta classifier authored + **orchestrator-verified 13/13 adversarial cases** (forward-flip PASS+audit; reverse-flip `[X]`→`[ ]` BLOCK — R1-S18; unpaired insert/delete BLOCK — R1-S04; edited-suffix BLOCK; scope guard holds — dirty assignment.md/plan.md still BLOCK via untouched strict path). Direction asymmetry confirmed load-bearing.
- `2026-07-12T20:05Z` | pre-flight T004 (agt_devtools_cli) | commit.sh phase enum `+testing` (enum L90 + die text + header) — `complete` intact, `sh -n` clean.
- `2026-07-12T20:05Z` | pre-flight T005 (agt_devtools_cli) | extension.yml `+after_complete(phase:complete)` `+after_testing(phase:testing)`, optional:false — YAML valid, siblings intact (12 hooks).
- `2026-07-12T20:20Z` | pre-flight T006 (agt_qa_automation) | run.sh §6 I-17 checkbox-delta survival regression (7 cases + reinstall×2 survival). Suite 37→ green.
- `2026-07-12T20:27Z` | pre-flight T007 (agt_qa_automation) | run.sh §7 SC-008 seam survival regression (`complete(id)`/`testing(id)` commits + hook routing + reinstall×2 survival). Suite → **46 passed, 0 failed**.
- `2026-07-12T20:31Z` | pre-flight T008 (agt_qa_automation) | **single bundled reinstall** `bash extensions/git/install.sh .` → deployed all three source edits into `.specify/extensions/git/` (byte-identical), auto-merged `after_complete`/`after_testing` into the installed registry (append-only, idempotent on 2nd install), suite **46/0**, pristine `verify-gate workforce` exit 0 silent. **Both survival regressions green.**
- `2026-07-12T20:33Z` | **pre-flight gate OPEN → Wave 1 RELEASED** | orchestrator-independently reconfirmed: suite 46/0, deploy byte-identical, checkbox-delta branch live in installed copy, tasks.md still pristine @ 9601bcd. This release is the **second half of the SC-010 refuse-then-release evidence pair**. Note (R1-S11): tasks.md is intentionally kept pristine THROUGH the pre-flight — the pre-flight commit carries git-ext source + installed tree + this log only, NO `[X]` marks — so Wave 1's gate check still sees the exact-match fast path, and the FIRST checkbox-delta PASS lands at Wave 2's check (after Wave 1's own `[X]`-mark, the "sole hazard").

## Wave loop (the testing-extension build)

- `2026-07-12T20:33Z` | Wave 1 gate re-verify | `verify-gate workforce` on pristine tasks.md @ 9601bcd → **exit 0, silent** (exact-match fast path — the fix leaves the clean case unperturbed; correctly NO audit line yet).
- `2026-07-12T20:49Z` | wave 1 | tasks: T001 | agents: 1 | outcome: success — scaffolded `extensions/testing/` (install.sh + uninstall.sh + README + extension/ & test/ tree roots; agt_devtools_cli). Ledger: marked **T001 [X]** and folded in the pre-flight **T003–T008 [X]** (7 forward checkbox advances now committed) — this is the first `[X]`-marking event, so the NEXT gate check (Wave 2) is the first to face a drifted tasks.md. Wave 1 commit `6ebc0c5`.

### 🎯 SC-010 — the zero-hand-assistance moment (durable evidence)

- `2026-07-12T20:51Z` | **Wave 2 gate re-verify** | tasks.md committed SHA `6ebc0c5` **≠** bound `9601bcd` → the strict SHA check would BLOCK. The installed (post-fix) `verify-gate workforce` instead **PASSED, exit 0, unassisted**, via the checkbox-delta branch. The S09 durable audit line (verbatim):

  > `verify-gate.sh: workforce gate PASS via checkbox-delta — tasks.md: 7 forward GFM checkbox advance(s) since approved SHA 9601bcdb44433957e55651008cbe2c297985d9dd, no other change (R1-S09)`

  This is SC-010's zero-hand claim becoming true on M4's own run: a wave-2+ freshness check clearing a drifted (but checkbox-only) tasks.md with no human re-gate, leaving independently-auditable evidence (the audit line distinguishes the fix from a human workaround). The refuse-then-release pair is now closed end to end: **REFUSE** (pre-flight, Wave 1 blocked until T008) → **RELEASE** (T008 green) → **PASS-unassisted** (this line). Every subsequent wave's gate check re-exercises the same branch.

- `2026-07-12T20:55Z` | wave 2 | tasks: T002 | agents: 1 | outcome: success — testing-ext manifest (`extension.yml`: provides.commands speckit.complete + speckit.testing, no hooks — D57 §9) + `testing-config.yml` (tester.model: sonnet D18, executed: none guard); agt_devtools_cli. Gate check (pre-dispatch) had passed via checkbox-delta (7 advances, audit line above). T002 [X].
- `2026-07-12T21:05Z` | Wave 3 gate re-verify | `verify-gate workforce` → PASS via checkbox-delta (8 advances), exit 0, unassisted.
- `2026-07-12T21:35Z` | wave 3 | tasks: T009, T012, T017 | agents: 3 (parallel) | outcome: success — three disjoint `docs/contracts/` files: `completion-report.md` contract (T009, agt_devtools_cli — 6 exact core + 2 optional appendix sections, SC-005, D19 body, R1-S19 machine-checkable), `testing-doc.md` contract (T012, agt_ai_agents — executed:none, coverage map 1-row-per-SC+FR bijection, report-claimed/log-verified R1-S05, gap-honesty), `artifact-layout.md` §6 ownership +2 rows (T017, agt_devtools_cli — Complete→completion-report.md, Testing extension→testing.md). **Infra note:** the first Wave-3 dispatch (3 concurrent) hit a transient session-usage limit (all 3 failed mid-*read*, wrote nothing); re-dispatched (T009 solo probe → cleared, then T012+T017) — clean, no partial artifacts, no rework of committed state. T012 surfaced the **F4** cross-feature `001-FR-019` grep hazard (baked into the T016 prompt). T009/T012/T017 [X].
- `2026-07-12T21:55Z` | Wave 4 gate re-verify | `verify-gate workforce` → PASS via checkbox-delta (11 advances), exit 0, unassisted.
- `2026-07-12T22:40Z` | wave 4 | tasks: T010, T011, T013, T014, T015, T016 | agents: 6 (2 batches of 3 — session-limit mgmt) | outcome: success — the testing-ext build: `/speckit-complete` command+skill (T010, agt_devtools_cli — main-thread author, R1-S02 disk re-read, FR-001 no-new-role), completion-report.template (T011), `/speckit-testing` command+skill (T013, agt_ai_agents — 1 Sonnet tester dispatch, context-in report+spec only, status-only SC-003, R1-S06 context_in trace), tester-prompt (T014), testing.template + trace-fragment (T015), and the **T016 SC/FR coverage validator** (agt_qa_automation) — **43 passed / 0 failed**: F4 exclusion (naive 28 → 27 = 10 SC + 17 FR), two-golden completion-report validation (appendix-bearing + appendix-free, SC-005), golden testing.md bijection, install/uninstall byte-identical round-trip; R1-S19 goldens derived from the contracts' own §-lists. T013+T015 independently surfaced **F5** (R1-S06 `context_in` not yet in trace-schema.md). Batches dispatched 3+3 (never 6) to stay under the session-usage limit. T010/T011/T013/T014/T015/T016 [X].
- `2026-07-12T22:44Z` | Wave 5 gate re-verify | `verify-gate workforce` → PASS via checkbox-delta (17 advances), exit 0, unassisted.
- `2026-07-12T22:48Z` | wave 5 | tasks: T018 | agents: 1 | outcome: success — **installed the testing extension into the live repo** (`bash extensions/testing/install.sh .`; agt_qa_automation): byte-identical payload → `.specify/extensions/testing/`, 2 skills → `.claude/skills/`, `installed: [graphify, git, workforce, testing]` (append-only, git-ext's after_complete/after_testing rows intact), idempotent on 2nd install. Harness **43 passed / 0 failed** (orchestrator-reconfirmed). The 4th pipeline extension is live. T018 [X].
- `2026-07-12T22:49Z` | Wave 6 gate re-verify | `verify-gate workforce` → PASS via checkbox-delta (18 advances), exit 0, unassisted.
- `2026-07-12T22:52Z` | wave 6 | tasks: T019 | agents: 1 | outcome: success — **quickstart SC-001…010 validation map** (agt_qa_automation; read-only, did NOT run the live complete/testing phases). **6 PASS-now:** SC-004 (100% coverage validator + gap-honesty), SC-005 (two-golden appendix parity), SC-007 (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset D28; one net-new role = Sonnet tester), SC-008 (git-ext seam survives git-ext + foreign reinstall, harness 46/0 §7), SC-010 (this run's audit lines + block-half via §6), SC-003 (design-level). **4 DEFERRED to M4's downstream run** (require the live phases past this STOP boundary): SC-001, SC-002, SC-006, SC-009 — confirmed no `completion-report.md`/`testing.md`/phase-tagged commits exist yet. T019 [X].

## Wave loop complete — 19/19 tasks [X]; STOP boundary reached

All six waves done (T001–T019); the pre-flight bundled git-ext change is live and survival-verified; the testing extension is built + installed. **SC-010 proven live this run** (waves 2–6 each cleared `verify-gate workforce` via the checkbox-delta branch, unassisted, audit lines above). Per the run boundary, the implement phase **STOPS here** — the `complete` and `testing` phases (which produce `completion-report.md` + `testing.md`, closing SC-001/002/006/009) get their first live run on 004 itself as a separate session. Findings F1–F5 booked (`findings.md`).
