## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

This command takes no arguments — its behavior is fully determined by `categorization.md`, the on-disk `.claude/agents`/`.claude/skills` library, and `profile.yaml`'s `gates.workforce.mode`. Non-empty `$ARGUMENTS` is unexpected; ignore it rather than inventing a flag `commands.md` doesn't define.

## What this is

`/speckit-agent-assign` is the **agent-assign** phase (`artifact-layout.md` §2 phase table), running immediately after `/speckit-categorize`. Per the plan's technical-approach split — "categorization = inference (Sonnet), assembly = code, skill-building = inference (Sonnet)" — this command's deterministic core is **not an LLM session**: `assemble.py` (`agent-library-schema.md` §3, verbatim) reads `categorization.md` and the base+skill library, matches every task to a base specialist plus up to 3 ranked skills, and **writes `agents/assignment.md`'s `### Roster approved` table itself** — a tool-permission fact (S08), not a prose promise, and the mechanism that makes SC-005's byte-identical-on-gap-free-rerun claim real.

**Full contract, as of T025.** This command implements all three of `commands.md`'s behavior steps: (1) run `assemble.py`, emit the roster + gap list; (2) on a non-empty gap list, dispatch one Sonnet `skill-builder` per shared-tag gap cluster, validate, and persist each pass into `.claude/skills/` (`## 2. Gap handoff`, below); (3) re-run `assemble.py` once more so newly-built skills carry the `built` mark (FR-022) before the roster is handed to gate resolution. A run whose Step 1 `GAP_TASKS` is empty never dispatches anything — `tasks.md`'s own dependency notes call this "US2 … viable without the builder," and that stays true: the builder is additive, not load-bearing, for a feature whose tags the static library already covers. A run that dispatches the builder and still can't close every gap (a hard-fail collision, S07, or a rejected module, FR-007) is not a failure either — `## 2. Gap handoff` surfaces exactly which task(s) remain open, and the roster stays a valid, committable interim state (the same "no fabricated skill, ever" posture this command has always held) pending a human decision or a later re-run.

## Pre-Execution

1. **Resolve the feature.** Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from the repo root; parse `REPO_ROOT`, `BRANCH`, `FEATURE_DIR` (absolute paths — use them absolute in every subsequent command this session).

2. **Precondition: `categorization.md` must exist.** If `$FEATURE_DIR/categorization.md` is missing, STOP: "no categorization.md — run /speckit-categorize first." Write nothing.

3. **Don't silently clobber an already-signed gate.** If `$FEATURE_DIR/agents/assignment.md` already exists, read its `## Workforce Gate` table's `decision` cell. `assemble.py` always re-renders the **entire** file fresh from `assignment.template.md` on every invocation — it has no "patch an existing file" mode — copying the template's `[PENDING ...]` bracket markers through unchanged. A naive re-run after a human has already signed would therefore silently destroy the recorded decision.
   - `decision` is `` `rejected` `` → proceed. This *is* the reassignment path (`artifact-layout.md` §8 W3): a fresh roster proposal is exactly what should happen next.
   - `decision` is `` `approved` `` or `` `approved-with-notes` `` → **STOP**: "`agents/assignment.md` already carries a signed Workforce Gate (`<decision>`, reviewer `<reviewer>`) — re-running `/speckit-agent-assign` would silently overwrite it. If this is a deliberate re-assign, preserve the signed roster first (e.g. `git show`/a copy); this command will not do it silently." Do not proceed.
   - `decision` is still a `[PENDING ...]` marker, or the file doesn't exist yet → proceed normally; nothing signed is at risk.

4. **S14 freshness check — the load-bearing precondition this command exists to add.** `assemble.py` itself only *stamps* the `tasks.md` SHA `categorization.md` recorded; it deliberately does **not** compare it against the live `tasks.md` (its own module docstring, "Scope note (S14)": *"this script extracts and stamps that value for visibility but does NOT compare it against the current tasks.md -- that freshness check is /speckit-agent-assign's job"*). That comparison happens here, before `assemble.py` ever runs.

   a. **Read the recorded SHA.** `categorization.md`'s header carries the line `> **Source binding (S14):** derived from \`tasks.md @ <sha>\` (<N> tasks).` (written by `/speckit-categorize`, `categorizer-prompt.md` §4). Extract `<sha>`. If the line is missing, or `<sha>` doesn't parse as a short hex commit id, treat it the same as a mismatch below — never assume freshness you can't confirm.

   b. **Compute the current SHA.** `git log -1 --format=%h -- "$FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md"` — the identical command `categorizer-prompt.md` §4 itself uses, so the two sides are always comparing like-for-like.

   c. **Check for uncommitted drift too.** `git status --short "$FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md"`. Non-empty output means `tasks.md` carries local changes not yet committed — even if (b)'s SHA still matches, the working tree no longer matches what was categorized.

   d. **Compare.** Recorded SHA == current SHA **and** no local changes → fresh; proceed to Step 1, and name the confirmed SHA in the Completion Report. Otherwise (mismatch, an unparseable recorded SHA, or local drift) → **HARD-WARN and STOP**, before running `assemble.py`:
      > `tasks.md` has moved since `categorization.md` was derived (categorized @ `<recorded-sha-or-"unparseable">`, `tasks.md` now @ `<current-sha>`[, plus uncommitted local changes]) — re-run `/speckit-categorize` before `/speckit-agent-assign`. Assembling against a stale classification is exactly what S14 exists to prevent.

      Write nothing; do not proceed to Step 1.

## 1. Run `assemble.py` (zero-AI, deterministic)

Invoke the installed script — `.specify/extensions/workforce/scripts/assemble.py` (fall back to the repo source `extensions/workforce/extension/scripts/assemble.py` only if the extension isn't installed in this repo yet, the same fallback convention `/speckit-council-triage` uses for `chairman-prompt.md`):

```
python3 <assemble.py path> "$FEATURE_DIR/categorization.md" \
  --library-dir "$REPO_ROOT/.claude" \
  --output "$FEATURE_DIR/agents/assignment.md"
```

This first invocation never passes `--built-skill` — nothing has been built yet at this point in the run. If `GAP_TASKS` (below) comes back non-empty and `## 2. Gap handoff` goes on to persist one or more skills, that section re-invokes this exact command a second time, passing one `--built-skill <id>` per persisted skill (S15) — see `## 2. Gap handoff` step (d); that second invocation is never issued here.

**Exit code contract**, straight from `assemble.py`'s own CLI docstring:

| Exit | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Roster written. | Continue to Step 2. Parse stdout (below). |
| `2` | D48 guard violated (FR-014/SC-006) — a `prompt`-tagged task assembled onto a non-Sonnet base. Nothing written. | Hard error. Report the stderr line verbatim (it names the task/base). Stop — this is a library defect, not something to route around. |
| `3` | Malformed input or a library invariant violation (duplicate id, non-unique `(type, specialization)` lane, missing `agt_generic` fallback, missing `skl_refactor_discipline` when required, template render failure — or a missing `.claude/agents`/`.claude/skills` dir entirely). Nothing written. | Report the stderr line verbatim. If it names a missing agents/skills dir, point at `extensions/workforce/install.sh` — the seed library may never have been installed. Stop. |
| `4` | A library entry's frontmatter failed to parse (`frontmatter.py`'s `FrontmatterError`). Nothing written. | Report the stderr line verbatim (it names the offending file). Stop. |

On any non-zero exit, `agents/assignment.md` is untouched (assemble.py's own contract: "nothing was written") — there is nothing to commit; skip straight to the Completion Report with the failure.

**On exit `0`, parse stdout** (assemble.py's fixed output shape, `main()`):
- `assemble.py: wrote <path> (<R> roster row(s) over <T> task(s))` — row/task counts for the report.
- `GAP_TASKS: <comma-separated task ids, or nothing>` — the ∅-match list. `GAP_TASKS: ` with nothing after the colon means gap-free.
- `assemble.py: empty lane (FR-016) on: <ids>` — present only if a task fell to `agt_generic` on an unmatched `(type, specialization)` lane. Informational, not an error.
- `assemble.py: <n> skill(s) dropped by the cap (FR-011/SC-004)` — present only if the 3-skill injection cap trimmed a candidate; already logged in the roster's own notes (`{{DROPPED_SKILL_NOTES}}`).
- `LIBRARY_SNAPSHOT_HASH: <hash>` — the S18 content-hash of the base+skill library at this run's start; already stamped into `agents/assignment.md`'s own header too.

`assemble.py` has now written the complete `### Roster approved` table and the `## Workforce Gate`'s `[PENDING ...]` markers into `agents/assignment.md` **itself** (S08). Nothing in this command hand-edits that table, ever — the closest this command comes to touching the file is Step 3 below, and even then only the five bracket-marked gate fields, never a roster row.

## 2. Gap handoff (skill-builder → validate → persist → re-run)

Runs only when Step 1's `GAP_TASKS` is **non-empty**. If it was empty, skip straight to Step 3 — no session is dispatched, no `traces.jsonl` record is appended, and Step 1's roster is already final (SC-005's gap-free, byte-identical claim holds exactly as it did before T025).

Otherwise this section implements `commands.md`'s remaining behavior steps 2–3 in full: for each gap, dispatch a Sonnet `skill-builder` holding its declared `web_search` grant (D60) → validate (`validate-skill.py`: S1–S3 plus the S04 tag-intersection) → persist a pass to `.claude/skills/` (FR-008) → re-run `assemble.py` once more so the final roster carries every `built` mark FR-022 requires. Resolve `skill-builder-prompt.md` and `validate-skill.py` the same installed-vs-source way Step 1 already resolves `assemble.py`'s own path (`frontmatter.py` is `validate-skill.py`'s sibling — resolving the directory carries it along, the same note Pre-Execution step 3 makes for the categorizer's own validator).

**a. Group gaps by shared tag — one dispatch per cluster, never per task (FR-006/SC-007/S24).**

For every task id in `GAP_TASKS`, look up its `(type, specialization, tags)` row directly in `$FEATURE_DIR/categorization.md`'s own table (already on disk — there is no script that dumps a single row). A gap task's *entire* tag list is uncovered by construction (`assemble.py`'s own `skill_gap` definition: zero tag-intersection candidates found against the whole library), so build one graph over just the gap tasks — an edge between two whenever their tag lists intersect — and take its **connected components** as clusters. Two gap tasks sharing one novel tag land in the same cluster and get **exactly one** `skill-builder` dispatch between them, never one each (`skill-builder-prompt.md`'s own words: "a shared tag across several gapped tasks is precisely the case where one well-scoped module should cover all of them"). A gap task sharing no tag with any other gap task is its own cluster of one. Order clusters by their lowest member task id, ascending (mirrors `assemble.py`'s own `_task_sort_key`) — builder authorship is LLM output, not covered by SC-005's determinism claim, but a fixed order still keeps the run's Completion Report legible.

**b. Per cluster, serially — never in parallel (collision-safety, S07).**

Process clusters one at a time, start to finish (dispatch → read the return → validate → persist-or-reject → trace), before starting the next. This is load-bearing: a builder's own Step-1 self-check (`skill-builder-prompt.md` — Glob `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` before naming) and `validate-skill.py`'s id-collision check (`_find_id_collision`, globbing that same live `library_dir`) only see what's *actually on disk* at the moment they run. Serial processing means cluster 2's builder — and its own validator pass — sees cluster 1's skill if cluster 1 persisted, closing the one collision hole a per-cluster self-check can't see alone (two clusters independently picking the same name in the same run). Parallel dispatch would silently reopen that hole.

For each cluster, in order:

  i. **Stage.** `mktemp -d` for a fresh scratch directory — outside the repo, so nothing lands in the feature tree even transiently (this command's only artifact in `specs/<feature>/` stays `agents/assignment.md`, per `commands.md`'s own header). This dispatch's `{{output_path}}` is `<scratch-dir>/SKILL.md`.

  ii. **Render.** Substitute `skill-builder-prompt.md`'s five slots verbatim: `{{feature}}` → the spec id; `{{task_ids}}` → this cluster's task ids, comma-joined, ascending; `{{task_type}}`/`{{task_specialization}}` → the cluster's lowest-id task's own values (note plainly in the Completion Report if other members disagree — the module selects by tags, not this pair, so a divergence is informational, never a blocker); `{{task_tags}}` → the union of every member's tags, comma-joined; `{{output_path}}` → (i)'s literal scratch path.

  iii. **Dispatch.** One Sonnet subagent via the `Agent` tool, the rendered text as the literal `prompt` — `subagent_type: general-purpose`, the same generic file-writing/tool-using rationale `/speckit-categorize` and `/speckit-council` already apply to their own Sonnet dispatches. No extra tool-grant wiring is needed or possible beyond that: `general-purpose` already carries `WebSearch`, and D60/A-2's "the skill-builder role holds `web_search`" is realized entirely by the rendered prompt telling the session so (`skill-builder-prompt.md` Step 5) — the audit boundary is the trace record (c) and the roster, never a Claude-Code permission scope. No `isolation` is needed either — each cluster's scratch dir is already unique (`mktemp -d`), so there is no file-collision risk between this dispatch and any other. Barrier: wait for the return.

  iv. **Read the one-line return** — `skill-builder-prompt.md`'s own contract has exactly three shapes:
      - `Wrote <path> (...) — ...; searched: <yes|no>.` — a draft exists at the scratch path. Note `searched:` (it drives (c)'s `elevated_grants`). Continue to (v).
      - `Collision on <id|name> — hard-failed, forwarding for resolution (S07).` — **no file was written** (the builder's own Step 1 runs before it writes anything). This cluster's task(s) stay gapped. Report the collision verbatim. Skip to (c)'s trace, then the next cluster.
      - `Collision on <id|name> — renamed to <new-name> (S07).` — a draft **was** written, under the renamed identity. Continue to (v), noting the rename plainly.
      - Anything else, or no return at all (a broken one-line contract, a crash, a timeout): mirror `/speckit-categorize` Step 1's own edge case — never fabricate a status, never retry silently. Check whether `<scratch-dir>/SKILL.md` actually exists regardless of what came back — the file, not the reply, is authoritative. If it exists, continue to (v) anyway; if not, this cluster's task(s) stay gapped, note the broken contract/dispatch failure in one line, and still append a best-effort trace ((c), `outcome: "failed"`) before moving on.

  v. **Validate** (S1–S3, S04, FR-007):
     ```
     python3 <validate-skill.py path> "<scratch-dir>/SKILL.md" "<lead task's tags>" "$REPO_ROOT/.claude/skills"
     ```
     `<lead task's tags>` = the cluster's lowest-id task's own tag list (the "triggering task's tags" `validate-skill.py`'s CLI names). `library_dir` is the **real, live** `.claude/skills`, not the scratch dir — this independently re-checks the id-collision the builder already self-checked. Exit `0` → continue to (vi). Non-zero → **rejected, not persisted** (FR-007): report every `REJECTED:` / `  - ` stderr line verbatim, never summarized away. This cluster's task(s) stay gapped; no retry this run (mirrors `/speckit-categorize`'s own "a FAIL means stop and report... a human decides" posture). Go to (c), then the next cluster.

  vi. **Persist** (FR-008) — the *only* edit this command ever makes to a skill-builder's own content:
      - Compute `body_sha256` of the draft's body (everything after the closing `---` fence) by importing the **shared** `frontmatter.py` (S21 — `split_frontmatter` + `body_sha256`); never hand-roll a second hash (`skill-builder-prompt.md`'s own words: "the persistence step computes it from what you wrote").
      - Edit the draft's `body_sha256: null` line to that hash — the one byte this command changes; every other line, including a S07 rename, stays exactly as authored.
      - Read the draft's own top-level `name:` field (kebab-case) — the target directory, matching every seed skill's own convention (`.claude/skills/orchestration/SKILL.md` ↔ `name: orchestration`); never re-derive a slug from `id:` or from the task.
      - **One more live-collision guard, immediately before the write** (closing the residual same-run race (b)'s serial ordering already narrows to near-zero): if `$REPO_ROOT/.claude/skills/<name>/` already exists, treat it exactly like a builder-reported collision — hard-fail this cluster, report it, never silently overwrite. Otherwise `mkdir -p` it and write the hash-patched file to `$REPO_ROOT/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, with `origin: generated` and `provenance.source_feature` exactly as the draft carried them (already re-validated by (v)) — never `origin: promoted`; promotion is a separate, manual action this command never performs (FR-009).
      - Record the persisted skill's `specseyal.id` into this run's growing `BUILT_SKILL_IDS` list — (d) below passes every id in it to the re-run's `--built-skill`. Remove the scratch directory.

**c. Trace — one `agent-creator` record per dispatch attempted, appended immediately (never batched across clusters — the same serial-append discipline `/speckit-council` and `/speckit-categorize` hold for their own dispatches).**

One record per *cluster* (matching (a)'s dedup: three gapped tasks sharing one tag still produce one dispatch and one trace, never three). A cluster whose builder hard-failed a collision or whose draft was rejected still had a real dispatch happen — it still gets exactly one trace, `outcome: "failed"`.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `schema_version` | `"1.0"` |
| `trace_id` | fresh, unique |
| `parent_trace_id` | `null` — this command's own invocation is main-thread, not itself a traced role (same convention as `/speckit-categorize` Step 4 and council's top-level fragments) |
| `feature` | the spec id |
| `phase` | `"agent-assign"` |
| `role` | `"agent-creator"` (`trace-schema.md` §2) |
| `agent_id` | `null` (non-null iff `role == "implementer"` — a skill-builder dispatch never is, trace-schema.md §7 rule 4) |
| `skills` | `[]` (the builder is a fixed-role session, not an assembly — trace-schema.md §7 rule 5) |
| `elevated_grants` | `["web_search"]` iff (iv)'s return read `searched: yes`; `[]` otherwise, including on every hard-fail/rejected/dispatch-failure outcome — the dispatch's own declared grant (D60), recorded per D43 |
| `model` | `"claude-sonnet-5"` — exact id, never the alias `sonnet` (`workforce-config.yml`'s `model: sonnet` resolves to this) |
| `effort` | `"medium"` — the same Sonnet-mechanical-role precedent `/speckit-categorize`'s own trace uses |
| `started_at`/`ended_at`/`duration_ms` | this dispatch's actual wall-clock span |
| `tokens`/`capture_method` | transcript-based attribution (D47); fall back honestly to `capture_method: "unavailable"` / `tokens: null` when unavailable — never guessed |
| `outcome` | `"success"` iff (vi) persisted; `"failed"` on a hard-fail collision, a `validate-skill.py` rejection, a no-file broken-contract return, or a dispatch failure |
| `artifact` | the persisted repo-relative path, `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, on success (outside `specs/<feature>/`, same as the file itself — D24/S07); `null` on every failed outcome |
| `cost_usd` | `null` (D28) |

**d. The mandatory re-run — once, after every cluster has been attempted, never per-cluster (S15).**

If `BUILT_SKILL_IDS` (accumulated across (b.vi)) is **non-empty**, re-invoke `assemble.py` exactly one more time, now passing one `--built-skill <id>` per persisted skill:

```
python3 <assemble.py path> "$FEATURE_DIR/categorization.md" \
  --library-dir "$REPO_ROOT/.claude" \
  --output "$FEATURE_DIR/agents/assignment.md" \
  --built-skill <id-1> [--built-skill <id-2> ...]
```

Handle its exit code exactly per Step 1's own 0/2/3/4 table — no second table here. On `0`: this write **supersedes** Step 1's roster and stdout numbers entirely — its `GAP_TASKS` / empty-lane / dropped-skill / `LIBRARY_SNAPSHOT_HASH` lines are what Step 3 and the Completion Report use from here on. Any task a cluster didn't actually close (an imperfect grouping, tags that didn't fully overlap the built skill) simply reappears in this second `GAP_TASKS` — `assemble.py` recomputes tag-intersection mechanically per task against the now-grown library, so under-coverage is caught here honestly, with no extra bookkeeping required of this section. S15 guarantees every task that was **not** in Step 1's `GAP_TASKS` renders byte-identically in this rewrite; this command relies on that guarantee rather than re-verifying it (that's `test_assemble.sh`'s/T026's job). On non-zero: report the failure exactly as Step 1 would; `agents/assignment.md` is left exactly as Step 1 wrote it (assemble.py's own "nothing written on a non-zero exit" contract applies here too); skills already persisted in (b.vi) remain on disk regardless — they independently passed (v) — but this run stops here, before Step 3; a human resolves it and a later `/speckit-agent-assign` run picks the roster back up.

If `BUILT_SKILL_IDS` is empty (every cluster hard-failed a collision or was rejected — nothing persisted), skip the re-run: nothing grew the library, so Step 1's roster and gap list are already final.

**No retry within a single run.** Whether a cluster hard-fails a collision or its module is rejected by (v), this section attempts it exactly once and moves on — the same "stop and report, let a human decide" posture `/speckit-categorize` holds for its own validator FAIL. A task still gapped after this one pass stays gapped, surfaced plainly; a fresh `/speckit-agent-assign` run (after a human or a library fix) gets a fresh attempt, since `categorization.md` is unchanged and `assemble.py` rediscovers the same gap deterministically.

## 3. Gate resolution (`gates.workforce.mode`)

Read `$FEATURE_DIR/profile.yaml`. If absent, unparseable, or `gates.workforce.mode` unset: mode is `human` (`profile-schema.md` P1 — a missing/broken profile is always the safest posture, never the fastest one). Otherwise read `gates.workforce.mode` literally.

- **`human`** (default) → do nothing further. `assemble.py` already left every gate field a `[PENDING ...]` marker; it stays that way, pending `/speckit-workforce-approve` (T017).

- **`auto`, and no gap remains open after `## 2. Gap handoff`** (Step 1's `GAP_TASKS` was empty to begin with, **or** Step 2 dispatched the builder and its re-run's `GAP_TASKS` came back empty) → **this command writes the gate decision itself**, standing in for `/speckit-workforce-approve`'s own eventual write (FR-020). Unlike the council gate, workforce's `auto` is valid **standalone** — `profile-schema.md` P4: *"`gates.workforce.mode: auto` alone is valid with `full_auto: false`. The workforce gate is an economic guard … Only the correctness guard [council] is protected."* So this branch is **not** gated on `full_auto` the way `/speckit-council-triage` gates its own auto-write on the council handshake — read `gates.workforce.mode` alone.

  Edit `agents/assignment.md` in place, replacing exactly the five `[PENDING ...]` bracket markers `assignment.template.md` defines (never touch the `### Roster approved` table above them):
  ```markdown
  ## Workforce Gate — <ISO-8601 UTC timestamp>

  | Field | Value |
  |---|---|
  | reviewer | auto |
  | decision | `approved` |
  | reviewed | `categorization.md`, `assignment.md` (this roster) |
  ```
  and, naming plainly which of the two cases actually happened (never blur them — one is SC-005's byte-identical claim, the other isn't):
  ```markdown
  **Notes:** Auto-approved under `gates.workforce.mode: auto` — gap-free roster (zero `built` marks, SC-005).

  **Overrides:** none.
  ```
  or
  ```markdown
  **Notes:** Auto-approved under `gates.workforce.mode: auto` — <N> gap(s) closed this run by the skill-builder (`## 2. Gap handoff`: <M> skill(s) built, `skl_…@…` listed). Not a byte-identical/SC-005 run (LLM-authored content this run) — the re-run's `GAP_TASKS` came back empty.

  **Overrides:** none.
  ```
  (Same section, same position — only the bracket text changes; the heading line, table shape, and everything from `### Roster approved` down stay exactly as `assemble.py` wrote them.)

  **Known gap, not silently glossed over.** `commands.md`'s "Signer-agnostic (FR-010/W4)" clause requires the *same* `after_workforce_approve` gate-write to fire here that `/speckit-workforce-approve` triggers in human mode — binding `tasks.md` + `assignment.md@sha` into `gates.yml` via `on-gate-approve.sh workforce` (`git/extension.yml`). If that hook isn't reachable in this repo (git-ext not installed, or not yet reinstalled with the workforce gate wired), an auto-approval written by this step does **not** produce a `gates.yml` binding; say so plainly in the Completion Report rather than fabricating one.

- **`auto`, but at least one gap is still open after `## 2. Gap handoff`** (a hard-fail collision, a rejected module, or a cluster Step 2 simply didn't close) → **do not auto-approve.** Mirrors `/speckit-council-triage` never auto-approving a residual `blocking` item: an auto-approved roster with unresolved gaps would silently skip the exact review a newly-grown library deserves at the gate. Leave every gate field `[PENDING ...]`, and list plainly in the Completion Report which task(s) remain gapped and why (collision / rejected / not attempted) — a human decides how to proceed.

## 4. Commit — the `after_agent-assign` hook

Only when Step 1 exited `0` (something was actually written). `workforce/extension.yml` registers `after_agent-assign → speckit.git.commit` (phase `agents`, `optional: false`); v1 has no separate HookExecutor — *"the invoking phase-skill runs the hook and honors its exit code"* (`workforce/extension.yml`'s own hooks-header note) — so this command fires it directly:

```
<git-ext commit.sh path> agents "assemble roster from categorization.md (<T> tasks, <R> row(s)<, gap-free | , <N> gap(s) closed via skill-builder (<M> built) | , <N> gap(s) still open>)"
```

Prefer the installed path `.specify/extensions/git/scripts/commit.sh`; fall back to the repo source `extensions/git/extension/scripts/commit.sh` only if git-ext isn't installed in this repo yet — and if neither is found, do not fail the phase over a missing packaging dependency: note in the Completion Report that the roster was written but not committed, and why.

`commit.sh agents <summary>` composes the phase-tagged message `agents(<spec-id>): <summary>` itself (its own FR-006 grammar), self-heals onto the feature branch first, stages `specs/<spec-id>/**` (which already covers `agents/assignment.md`), and no-ops (exit 0, no commit) if nothing in scope actually changed — e.g. a re-run that reproduced a byte-identical roster. It prints only the new commit SHA (or nothing, on no-op) to stdout; it is itself mechanical git with **no model call and no `traces.jsonl` write** (`commit.sh`'s own header).

## Observability — one `agent-creator` trace per gap dispatch, never per task

`commands.md`'s Trace row for `/speckit-agent-assign` reads "one `agent-creator` record per skill-builder session (none on a gap-free run — R2/★★)." This command now implements that exactly: `assemble.py` itself is zero-AI (no trace — `commands.md`'s own header rule) and the gate-resolution/commit steps are mechanical (no session, the same no-session pattern the council gate follows) — so the *only* source of `traces.jsonl` records anywhere in this command is `## 2. Gap handoff`'s per-cluster dispatch loop (its own step c). A **gap-free** run (Step 1's `GAP_TASKS` empty) dispatches nothing and appends **zero** records, exactly as before T025. A **gap** run appends exactly one record per cluster dispatched — one per shared-tag group, never one per gapped task (the same SC-007/FR-006 dedup that governs the dispatch itself) — regardless of whether that cluster's dispatch ultimately persisted a skill, was rejected, hard-failed a collision, or never returned; every attempted dispatch leaves exactly one trace, `outcome: "success"` or `"failed"` accordingly.

## Completion Report

Report, concisely:
- Feature/spec-id.
- S14 freshness: the confirmed SHA, or the STOP reason if it stopped there.
- `assemble.py` (Step 1) outcome: exit code; on `0`, task/row counts, `GAP_TASKS` (or "gap-free"), empty-lane ids (if any), dropped-skill count (if any), `LIBRARY_SNAPSHOT_HASH`; on non-zero, the stderr line and which exit path (and stop — Step 2 never runs).
- Gap handoff (`## 2. Gap handoff`, only if Step 1 found gaps): cluster count and membership (which task ids grouped together, SC-007); per cluster, its outcome (persisted `skl_…@…`, rejected — reason, hard-failed collision, or dispatch failure) and whether it searched; the re-run's own exit code and its (possibly revised) `GAP_TASKS`/`LIBRARY_SNAPSHOT_HASH`; if skipped (gap-free at Step 1), say so in one line.
- Gate outcome: pending (`human`) | auto-approved this run (`auto`, no gap remains open — naming whether that's Step-1 gap-free/SC-005 or gaps closed this run, and flagging the `gates.yml` binding's reachability) | held pending despite `auto` (naming which task(s) are still gapped and why).
- Commit: the SHA `commit.sh` returned, "no-op", or "not committed — git-ext not installed".
- Trace count: the number of `agent-creator` records appended this run (zero on a gap-free run, one per cluster dispatched otherwise) — explicit either way, never silently omitted.
- Next step, stated explicitly (`/speckit-workforce-approve`, or "resolve the still-open gap(s) and re-run /speckit-agent-assign", or "re-run /speckit-categorize" if it stopped at S14).

## Done When

- [ ] Feature resolved; `categorization.md` precondition checked (stopped cleanly if absent)
- [ ] Signed-gate guard checked — never silently overwrote an `approved`/`approved-with-notes` decision
- [ ] S14 freshness verified (recorded SHA vs. current `tasks.md` SHA, plus a dirty-tree check) — hard-warned and stopped before running `assemble.py` on any drift
- [ ] Step 1's `assemble.py` invoked with no `--built-skill`; its exit code handled per its own 0/2/3/4 contract; `agents/assignment.md` left untouched on any non-zero exit
- [ ] On success: `GAP_TASKS`, empty-lane, dropped-skill, and `LIBRARY_SNAPSHOT_HASH` stdout lines parsed and reported; the `### Roster approved` table never hand-edited
- [ ] If `GAP_TASKS` was non-empty: gap tasks grouped into shared-tag clusters (connected components) — one `skill-builder` dispatch per cluster, never per task (FR-006/SC-007/S24); clusters processed **serially**, never in parallel (collision-safety, S07)
- [ ] Each cluster's builder return parsed for its three shapes (wrote / hard-failed collision / renamed collision) or handled as a broken-contract/dispatch failure per the file-is-authoritative rule; every candidate validated via `validate-skill.py` (S1–S3, S04) before being persisted — a rejection is surfaced, never persisted (FR-007)
- [ ] Every persist: `body_sha256` computed via the shared `frontmatter.py` (never hand-rolled) and stamped as the *only* edit made to the builder's content; target directory taken from the draft's own `name:` field; a last-second live-collision check guards the write; `origin: generated`/`source_feature` kept, never `origin: promoted` (FR-009); the skill's id recorded for the re-run
- [ ] If any skill was persisted: `assemble.py` re-run exactly once more with one `--built-skill <id>` per persisted skill; its exit code handled per Step 1's own contract; its (superseding) `GAP_TASKS`/`LIBRARY_SNAPSHOT_HASH` carried forward; if nothing was persisted, the re-run is skipped
- [ ] Exactly one `agent-creator` trace appended per cluster **dispatched** (success or failure alike), `elevated_grants: ["web_search"]` iff that dispatch's return said `searched: yes` — zero traces on a Step-1 gap-free run
- [ ] Gate mode resolved (`profile.yaml` → `human` default); `human` left pending; `auto` + no gap remains open wrote the decision in place (P4, not gated on `full_auto`, naming which case — Step-1 gap-free or gaps closed this run); `auto` + a gap still open held pending
- [ ] `after_agent-assign` hook fired via `commit.sh agents …` on any successful write; skipped gracefully (and reported) if git-ext isn't installed
- [ ] Trace count reported explicitly in the Completion Report, zero or otherwise — never silently omitted
- [ ] Completion Report delivered with a concrete next step
